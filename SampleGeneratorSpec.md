This shall be controlled via the generator control panel. Motorised breakers shall also be provided on all breakers designated for automatic switching for load shedding. The Contractor shall provide all necessary additional tripping batteries to faclitate this operation. 

It is proposed to locate the enclosure mounted generator system on <<location>>. The generator installation shall comprise the generator enclosure, flue and fuel delivery system.

Refuelling of the day tank shall be undertaken via a tanker parked in the service yard with a flexible hose to an external fill point as detailed on the layout drawings. Due to the height of the building, the fuel tanker can only pump up to an intermediate fuel tank in the loading area. From here the local pumps will pump up to the generator enclosure. The Bulk tank, day tank, and generator fuel pipework shall be a double skinned system with internal leak detection which shall alarm back to the generator control panel.

The generator exhaust shall be routed through the building to discharge at roof level.

The generator installation must adhere to the Council's acoustic requirements for emergency generators. It is envisaged that acoustic treatment will be required to achieve 77dBA @ 1 metre from the generator enclosure.

All automatic transfer switches (ATS) fed from the generator switchboard will be provided with mains failure relays wired back via controls cabling to the generator control panel to indicate that the generator start in the event of mains failure. Refer to electrical schematic for details. The ATS shall return to Utility mains supply once supply has returned for a minimum of 10 minutes or immediately in the event of secondary supply failure.

Operation:
Generator shall commence automatic start sequence 5 seconds (timer adjustable 0-120 seconds) after confirmation of mains failure. System shall automatically changeover to generator on generator reaching speed and generator being ready to receive load. System shall automatically changeover to mains 5 minutes (timer adjustable 0-60minutes) after confirmation of mains return. 

It is intended that the generator system starts automatically upon on a mains outage to support the essential loads / life safety services of the building - this will be via a mains failure signal from any of the ATS connected. The generator shall run for 30 mins after all the ATS's have automatically returned to mains supply.

At no point will the generator be connected in parallel with the mains supply.

An earth system shall be provided to ensure generator earthing in accordance with BS 7430:2011 + A1:2015, and any other ENW requirements.

A BMS connection shall be provided to the generator control panel to indicate fuel level, fault, and run status.

**Fuel Systems**

Day Tank:
The tanks shall be sized to contain 530liters of diesel fuel oil; the tanks shall be a double walled steel tank or single skin base tank within a bunded enclosure. 
The tank shall be incorporated within the generator skid. The fuel outlet inside the tank should be raised above the bottom of the tank in order to avoid sediment and or water entering the engine. A vent is also necessary. Means of returning any leaked or overflow fuel to the storage tank shall be provided on pumped fuel transfer systems.

Provide and install pipework and valves as required including: 
* Vent pipe; 
* Fuel supply pipe with cap, labelled "DIESEL FUEL"
* Drain pipe with valve to location external to base. 

Welded steel pipes or flexible double walled composite piping with inner stainless steel pipework shall be used throughout. After installation clean internally and flush.


**Fuel Transfer System** 

Pipework and Valves:
Supply and install all necessary pipes and valves. 

Steel Pipe Joints Welded or bolted flange and gasketted joints. 

Install valves to permit individual equipment items to be isolated for maintenance and replacement without draining system and provide check valves as necessary for correction operation.  Locate all valves in readily accessible position.

Labels:  Label all valves with identification which shall be shown on drawings. 

Pipework and Valve Installation 
Arrange and fix all pipework to provide neat appearance and grade for venting and draining to appropriate low point item, e.g., bulk storage tank, at 1:100 grade or better.  Vent and fill pipes shall be graded at 1:50 or better. 

Protect open ends with caps against ingress of dirt, etc., during installation and clean all pipework thoroughly after testing by flushing prior to first fill of fuel oil. 

Pressure test all completed pipework systems when complete and prior to back filling in accordance with Standards.  Repair leaks to approval.  Ensure that tanks are open when pressure testing pipework. 

Where pipework passes through structural elements, walls, floors, etc., provide sleeves of galvanised steel tube or PVC as appropriate to avoid electrolytic corrosion effects.  Underground and in damp areas seal between pipe and sleeve with a waterproof non-setting, fireproof compound. 
Install all pipework to avoid adverse effects due to movement in service for any reason.  Provide expansion loops, flexible connection, etc., and install fixings which permit movement. 
Paint all exposed fuel lines and label appropriately. Function and flow direction labels shall be provided.

Remote Fill Point 
Provide a remote fill point and associated pipework to service the generator fuel system. The remote fill point shall have the following features as minimum: 
* Clearly identified
* Fill and isolation valve (s)
* Non return valve   
* Fuel tank fill level indication   
* Overfill alarm (visual and audible) 

The fill point is positioned such that during filling operation, the fuel truck making delivery can park up to 30 meters and bring the delivery hose to the fill point. 

Testing and Commissioning:
There are two types of test required:
* Individual equipment/system Test
* Overall Verification Test

In the Individual test, the Contractor is required to demonstrate that the particular piece of equipment or system as may be the case is compliant with the specifications and meets the design intent.  Such a test includes switchboards, generators, and the like.

Overall verification test is a complete electrical system that that tests the functionality of the entire installation from the main incomers, transfer switches and the like.  For example, such a test is applicable to a Computer Room where the power supply, static transfer switch and emergency backup generators would be required to be tested as a fully functional and complete system.
